## Prevent Hydration Mismatch Without Flickering

When rendering content that depends on client-side storage (localStorage, cookies), avoid both SSR breakage and post-hydration flickering by injecting a synchronous script that updates the DOM before React hydrates.

**Incorrect (breaks SSR):**

```tsx
function ThemeWrapper({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  // localStorage is not available on server - throws error
  const theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light'
  
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Server-side rendering will fail because `localStorage` is undefined.

**Incorrect (visual flickering):**

```tsx
function ThemeWrapper({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Runs after hydration - causes visible flash
    const stored = localStorage.getItem('theme')
    if (stored) {
      setTheme(stored)
    }
  }, [])
  
  return (
    <div className={theme}>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Component first renders with default value (`light`), then updates after hydration, causing a visible flash of incorrect content.

**Correct (no flicker, no hydration mismatch):**

```tsx
function ThemeWrapper({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <>
      <div id="theme-wrapper" suppressHydrationWarning>
        {children}
      </div>
      <script
        dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
          __html: `
            (function() {
              try {
                var theme = localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light';
                var el = document.getElementById('theme-wrapper');
                if (el) el.className = theme;
              } catch (e) {}
            })();
          `,
        }}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

The inline script executes synchronously before showing the element, ensuring the DOM already has the correct value, so there is no flickering. Because the script changes `className` before React hydrates, add `suppressHydrationWarning` to that element — otherwise React flags the intentional server/client difference as a hydration mismatch (this is the same reason next-themes requires it on the `<html>` tag). Note that `suppressHydrationWarning` only applies one level deep, so put it on the exact element the script mutates.

This pattern is especially useful for theme toggles, user preferences, authentication states, and any client-only data that should render immediately without flashing default values.
