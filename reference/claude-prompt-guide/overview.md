## Core Techniques

Anthropic provides 9 core prompt engineering techniques for working with Claude:

1. **Prompt generator** - Automatically generate first draft prompt templates
2. **Be clear and direct** - Clear instructions and context lead to better outputs
3. **Use examples (multishot)** - Show Claude what you want with 3-5 examples
4. **Let Claude think (chain of thought)** - Encourage step-by-step reasoning
5. **Use XML tags** - Structure prompts with tags for clarity and parseability
6. **Give Claude a role (system prompts)** - Set tone and expertise with roles
7. **Prefill Claude's response** - Guide outputs by starting the assistant message
8. **Chain complex prompts** - Break down complex tasks into subtasks
9. **Long context tips** - Optimize for Claude's 200K token context window
